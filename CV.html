							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>
My training has provided me with the skills required to link geographic, contextual, and biological information from varied data sources to investigate how environmental and socioeconomic factors interact with underlying individual susceptibility to influence chronic disease outcomes. I am committed to mentoring and teaching students from all backgrounds to deepen and diversify knowledge. I advocate for health alongside the active Policy Committee members of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE).
